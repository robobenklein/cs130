# CS130 labs

Labs from CS130 @ UTK

These labs were mostly on ARM-based Arduinos, ARM assembly with some C++ wrapping.

These arduinos were using a general-purpose shield which included an LED segment display.  

To other CS130 students:  
Don't just copy my code, actually take the time to learn what they do and how they work.  
Copying without understanding won't get you anywhere and will hurt you more than you realize later on.

Sorry I didn't include any git history, I didn't keep git control over my code as I went along like I did for CS102, mainly because I was working on hardware/firmware instead of software like I normally do.

I didn't include many comments, but hopefully where I did you can find them helpful.
